## Introduction

GastroBook is a **desktop app for managing restaurant reservations for small scale restaurants who are only taking reservations for current day and next day, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Quick start**

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from our website.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your GastroBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar gastrobook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample reservation data.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all reservations.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 date/01/03/2025 time/1800 duration/2 pax/2 table/A1 t/regular t/event ` : Adds a reservation for `John Doe` to GastroBook.

   * `delete [validReservationID (ie: 1703202593441230)]` : Deletes the reservation with ID 1703202593441230.

   * `listrt` : Lists all reservations for today.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

   * `edit [validReservationID (ie: 1703202593441230)] n/John Doe p/98765432 date/01/03/2025 time/1800 duration/2 pax/2 table/A1 t/regular t/event ` : Edit tomorrow or today reservations details.
